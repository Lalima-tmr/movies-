👉🏻 There are two main types of databases:

👉🏻 **RDBMS (SQL)**
It is similar to saving data in Excel where the shape of the row/column is determined. With 500,000 pieces of data loaded, it will be difficult to suddenly add a row in the middle. However, as it is standardized, it can be easy for data consistency / analysis.
ex) MS-SQL, My-SQL, etc.

👉🏻 **No-SQL**

It is a DB that stores data in the form of a dictionary. Therefore, it is not necessary to have the same values for each data. Instead of being advantageous for loading data in a free form, it may lack consistency.
ex) MongoDB

## **Setting up the project**

>> MongoDB - Atlas registration
>> MongoDB - Atlas-hosted database connection 
    The role of the pymongo library
    
    If you wanted to interact with Microsoft Excel using Python, we need need a specialized Python library to do so.
    
    In the same way, we need a specialized Python library to convert our Python commands into a language that MongoDB can understand. That library is pymongo!
    We need to install the following libraries
                *pip install pymongo
                *pip install dnspython

>>Install packages
      >>>Install Flask package and start!
                *pip install flask
>>Scrap data from a page's meta tags
>>Create and use a new API
